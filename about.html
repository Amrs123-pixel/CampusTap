  <h2>About CampusTap</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>CampusTap</strong> is a thesis project developed to modernize school transportation
    and payment systems through the integration of RFID technology, GPS tracking, and
    cloud-based data management. The system provides students with a convenient tap-to-ride
    experience, automatically deducting fares from their digital balance while storing
    ride history in a secure cloud database.

    Built using <strong>Arduino-based RFID hardware</strong> paired with
    <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> and <strong>Firestore Database</strong>, CampusTap
    allows seamless user registration, secure login, real-time data updates, and accurate
    account management. Administrators can monitor student activity, top up balances, and
    manage accounts through a dedicated web dashboard.

    This thesis showcases the practical application of both hardware and software
    technologies to create an efficient, reliable, and cashless transportation solution
    for schools. CampusTap aims to improve safety, transparency, and convenience for
    students and provide administrators with powerful tools for monitoring and system
    management.
